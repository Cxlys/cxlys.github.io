                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>My name is Daniel Casley, a student at the University of Exeter pursuing a career in software engineering. I graduated from Exeter College A-Levels with an A in Computer Science and Maths, and a D* in Esports - while also acting as the student representative for my class.</p>
                <p>I have spent a large portion of my life being interested in computers, and have never stopped learning. I have skills in HTML/CSS, C# and Python, and my passion for games also lead me into hobbyist game development using the Unity Engine, where I have previously participated in challenges such as the GMTK Game Jam 2021.</p>
                <p>My passion for computing has led me into wanting to be a part of the rapidly growing industry that I've loved since a young age and so with this portfolio I hope to show that I have the skills you need.</p>

                <span>A website project that started as a college project using ASP.NET, Blazor and HTML/CSS elements to create an student-led educational website intended to be a mix between Kahoot and Quizlet, where students could submit questions for other students and answer them for points.</span>

                <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Interdimensional Jigsaw</h1>
                <span>A game I made as part of the GMTK Game Jam of 2021. I produced all the code and graphics and learned how to use UI elements over a span of just 3 days, and released it to Itch.io on the final day, 3 hours before deadline. This project was extremely challenging as I had never released a full game before, but it was extremely fun and I've since been on the lookout for communities in my area, and for the opportunity to join in again.</span>

                <span>I volunteered to work as a stream technician for the TSW Esports Festival - a festival with tens of massive corporations in the area going against eachother in Rocket League. I handled the technical side of OBS, graphics composition and scoreboard.</span>

                <span>This website was a project over the span of a few days as an effort to create a portfolio for myself. I put effort into using my penchant towards minimalism to make a dashboard that is easy on the eyes.</span>
